# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Rivers. I live in Albania. I love and enjoy coding, i am not very experienced in coding but i know HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript. My goal is to learn as many programming languages as i can.
I see myself as a developer in the near future. It's gonna take a lot of work, no excuses and being patient, but my goals and thoughts are crystal clear and i dont give a fuck what anybody says. I will keep doing my thing and prove everybody wrong. I'm hungry, i'm driven and i wont stop 'till i make it.
